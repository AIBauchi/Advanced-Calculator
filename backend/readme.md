The code in the `maths-functions.py` provided contains a series of mathematical functions written in Python. Each function takes one or more inputs and returns a result based on a specific mathematical operation.

The `factorial(x)` function takes a non-negative integer x and returns the factorial of that number. If x is negative, a ValueError is raised.

The `sqrt(x)` function takes a non-negative number x and returns the square root of that number using the Newton-Raphson method. If x is negative, a ValueError is raised.

The `nth_root(x, n)` function takes a positive number x and a positive integer n and returns the nth root of x. If x is negative and n is even, a ValueError is raised.

The `sin(x)` function takes an angle in radians x and returns the sine of that angle.

The `cos(x)` function takes an angle in radians x and returns the cosine of that angle.

The `tan(x)` function takes an angle in radians x and returns the tangent of that angle.

The `ln(x)` function takes a positive number x and returns the natural logarithm of that number. If x is non-positive, a ValueError is raised.

The `log10(x)` function takes a positive number x and returns the base 10 logarithm of that number. If x is non-positive, a ValueError is raised.

The `log(x, base)` function takes a positive number x and a positive base base and returns the logarithm of x to the base base. If x is non-positive, a ValueError is raised.
